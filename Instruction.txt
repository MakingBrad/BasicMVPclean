Goals for Collaboration:
1- Allow a user (not administrator) to click on the "edit button" for a specific design
    and then the user is taken to the "Edit Design" page/route.
2-When the user gets to the "edit design" page/route for the design they clicked on from
    #1 above - they will see a image of the sticker (the image will be larger than in the 
    design list) - they will also see other metadata they cannot edit 
    Cannot edit: Height, Width, image
    They will be able to edit the name of the sticker design.
    Once they write over the form element, they will be able to click "save"
    saving will use the exisiting 'put route' to 'put the new row, with the new name'
    into the database.
    Letting them know that they updated can be almost any workflow, right now I think
    that having an alert "The name for your design has been changed." and then
    taking them to the 'design list' will be the easiest implementation
3-Delete button - I want to make the delete button available to ADMIN on the DesignList
    (but not on the SingleUserDesigns component).  When an admin clicks delete, the delete 
    route (in component design router) will delete the row from the DB.
4-Assign a user to a design:
    On the create design page, I want to implement the component "SelectUserDropDown"
    so that admin can assign a design to one specific user.  So the 'create design' will
    assign the user to the design (and when the user looks at their "SingleUserDesigns"
    they will see the new 'created design' in their list.)
